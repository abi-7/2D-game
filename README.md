# Interactive about me page !

<h3>Hey there!ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p>
  This is a 2D interactive about me page where you can navigate through how I spend my day-to-day life!
</br>
  When entering the game the user is prompted with a option to choose what character they will be, they will then be spawned in a small house - right in the living room. 
  </br>
  As the user navigates themselves throughout the house they may bump into a few items - this will prompt a dialogue box for the user to read more about me!
</p>
<p>
  The controls for this game is just the click of your mouse or tap if your on mobile. The character will follow wherever you click!

  âœ¨This game is made using JavaScript and Kaboom.js (a JS library!) https://kaboomjs.com/
</br>
  âœ¨Inspiration for this game and how I learnt Kaboom came from https://www.freecodecamp.org/
